# Automated-Facial-Expression
Automated facial expression 
The problem addressed in this project is the need for an accurate and reliable automatic facial expression recognition system that combines texture and shape features from prominent facial regions for emotion detection in HCI. Emotion plays a crucial role in HCI, enabling machines to understand and respond appropriately to human affective states. However, existing facial expression recognition systems often rely on either texture or shape features alone, which may result in limited accuracy and effectiveness in emotion detection.
By combining texture and shape features from prominent facial regions, the aim is to create a more robust system capable of capturing a wider spectrum of emotional nuances. Texture features encompass details like skin patterns and color variations, while shape features pertain to the geometric structure and configuration of facial components. By integrating both, this proposed system seeks to overcome the shortcomings of relying solely on one type of feature, thereby potentially enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of emotion detection in HCI scenarios.
Overall, the objective is to bridge the gap in existing systems by developing a more sophisticated framework that can holistically interpret and discern emotions based on a comprehensive analysis of both texture and shape features in prominent facial regions.
